# Employee System 
This is my first java desktop application dating back to 2018 when 
i was trying to understand different ways to handle data
in a Java project. More less i creating a system that uses python to 
create delete update and read data with Python. Yes ...
Python... in a java Swing project... Never the less 
i found it and found interesting how i did that so
i shared it with you !
